            <h3>Software Engineer/Software Developer</h3>
            <p>As a recent graduate of the University of Muhammadiyah Malang with a Bachelor's degree in Informatics Engineering and a GPA of 3.86, I have completed relevant course in Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Engineering, Machine Learning, and Database Systems.

                I am knowledgeable in Python, Java, and Ruby, and possess excellent communication, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills. These skills make me a suitable candidate for the Generasi Gigih 2.0 program to intern as a backend engineer at Investree, one of their partner companies. My career aspiration is to become a software engineer/developer.
                
                Furthermore, I am adept at handling various daily tasks competently and welcome any recommendations that challenge me to maintain a growth mindset.</p>
